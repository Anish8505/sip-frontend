            <h2>What is a SIP (Systematic Investment Plan)?</h2>
            <p>
                SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) is a way of investing a fixed amount regularly
                into mutual funds or other investment products. Instead of putting a big amount
                in one shot, you invest monthly (or weekly/quarterly) and let compounding work
                over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, investing ₹5,000 every month for 10 years at 12% expected return
                can grow into several lakhs. Our SIP calculator helps you quickly estimate this
                maturity value and the profit over your invested amount.
            </p>

            <h3>How this SIP calculator works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monthly Investment:</strong> How much you want to invest every month.</li>
                <li><strong>Expected Return (%):</strong> Average annual return you expect from your investment.</li>
                <li><strong>Time Period (years):</strong> How long you will continue the SIP.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Behind the scenes, the calculator uses the standard SIP formula with monthly compounding
                to show:
                <strong>Invested Amount</strong>, <strong>Maturity Amount</strong> and <strong>Total Profit</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>What is a Lumpsum Investment?</h2>
            <p>
                A lumpsum investment is a one-time amount that you invest at once instead of spreading
                it across months. For example, investing ₹5,00,000 today and leaving it for 10 years
                at an expected return of 12% per year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our lumpsum calculator shows how much that single investment can grow over time, so you
                can compare SIP vs lumpsum for your financial goals.
            </p>

            <h3>When should you use SIP vs Lumpsum?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Choose SIP</strong> if you get a monthly salary and want to invest regularly.</li>
                <li><strong>Choose Lumpsum</strong> if you received a bonus, inheritance or have surplus cash.</li>
                <li>You can also combine both: lumpsum at the start + SIP every month.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Important note</h3>
            <p>
                The numbers shown by this calculator are <strong>estimates</strong> based on the return you enter.
                Actual market returns can be higher or lower. Always invest as per your risk profile and
                consult a financial advisor if needed.
